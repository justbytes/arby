# Arbitrage Trading bot

One of my aboandoned projects. EVM and Uniswap v2 & v3 fork compatibable. In the future this will get some much needed refactoring and implement Foundry instead of hardhat.

Gets a list of pairs/pools from Subgraph Explorer writes them all to a cache file. After that it filters them down by how much liquidity is in the pair/pool, if it has enough liquidity we send it to through the a websocket to a so it can be processed further. Once recieved we add a Swap event listner to the pair/pool and add any other nessessary data we need from it and write it to the target/active pairs/pools file. If a swap event occurs then we check our files to see if any dexs or pools can be arbitraged, if so we send it over another websocket for the trading process to take place. At the trading process we send all of the data needed to complete the aribtrage to the Solidity smart contract where it gets a flashloan and attempts to proceed with the transaction. Transactions are then recorded with relevent tax data and archived.
